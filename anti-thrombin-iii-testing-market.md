<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Anti-thrombin III Testing Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Diagnosis of antithrombin deficiency</li><li>Activity assays</li><li>Immunological assays</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Anti-thrombin III Testing Market is segmented into three main types. The diagnosis of antithrombin deficiency involves identifying low levels of this protein, crucial for blood clot regulation. Activity assays measure the functional ability of anti-thrombin to inhibit thrombin, reflecting its effectiveness in clot prevention. Immunological assays, on the other hand, quantify the concentration of anti-thrombin using antibody-based methods. Together, these testing types play a vital role in diagnosing and managing thromboembolic disorders.</p></p>
