<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Cardiac Pacemakers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Implantable Cardiac Pacemakers</li><li>External Cardiac Pacemakers</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The cardiac pacemakers market is primarily divided into two types: implantable and external pacemakers. Implantable cardiac pacemakers are surgically placed inside the body to regulate heartbeats for patients with irregular heart rhythms, offering long-term solutions. External cardiac pacemakers, on the other hand, are used temporarily and are not implanted, providing immediate pacing support for patients in critical condition or during surgeries. Both types play crucial roles in managing cardiac health and improving patient outcomes.</p></p>
