<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automotive Speed Encoder Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Axial Encoder</li><li>Radial Encoder</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The automotive speed encoder market encompasses two main types: axial encoders and radial encoders. Axial encoders measure the rotational speed by detecting changes along an axis, making them suitable for applications with limited space. Radial encoders, on the other hand, gauge speed by measuring rotation around a circular path, often providing higher accuracy. Both encoder types are essential for enhancing vehicle performance and safety, contributing to functions like anti-lock braking systems and traction control in modern automotive applications.</p></p>
